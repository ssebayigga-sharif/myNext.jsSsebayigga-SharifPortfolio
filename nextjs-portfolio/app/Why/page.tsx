      <h1>Why me.</h1>I am a passionate front-end developer dedicated to
      building fast, accessible, and visually appealing web experiences. Every
      line of code I write is driven by the desire to create interfaces that do
      not just work — they feel right. With a strong foundation in React,
      Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, My focus is on crafting responsive,
      and user-centered solutions that help businesses stand out online.

        <h2>What Makes Me Different</h2>
        Modern Front-End Stack: I build scalable, maintainable applications
        using the latest web technologies — including Next.js for performance,
        and Tailwind CSS for clean, efficient styling. I believe the small
        things make a big difference in user experience. Problem Solver: I enjoy
        transforming complex ideas into elegant, functional solutions.
        Collaborative Mindset: I thrive in team environments, communicate
        clearly, and adapt quickly to new challenges. Continuous Learning: The
        web evolves fast and so do I. I constantly improve my skills to stay
        ahead of trends and deliver top-quality results.
